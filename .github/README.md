# Binder2Deck
### A Lightweight Moxfield Deckbuilding Tool
This simple application will convert a [Moxfield](https://www.moxfield.com) binder CSV into decklist format.

[Download the latest release here](https://github.com/HenryVigor/binder2deck/releases/latest/download/Binder2Deck.zip)

#### How to use
1. Choose `Export CSV` in the options in your collection binder.
2. Drag or paste the downloaded file into the `IN` folder.
3. Double click `RUN.exe`. *This will delete the CSV.*
4. Open `OUT.txt` for the translated decklist.
5. When creating a new deck in [Moxfield](https://www.moxfield.com), choose `Paste in List` under `Existing Deck List` and paste the contents of the output file. If you wish to update an existing deck instead, this can be done in the `Bulk Edit` section.

**Note:** For special cards such as commanders, it may be easiest to remove them from the list and add them separately in the website.
